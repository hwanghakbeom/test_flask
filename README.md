# Flask Login Template
A simple but useful flask login template to start.

This a flask project based. Web development on Python.

We used flask_wtf, flask_sqlalchemy, and flask_login to make this project.

This a simple Flask APP to register and login as user into a website.

This an almost RAW project, there is just the necessary things to work perfectly:
Forms and its validations
Database to save entries
Queries and a log in and logout system with a "remember me" cookie.

We added a few static files (css, js and favicon) just to make the project easier to start.

Good luck! <3
